## goals

- appreciation for statistical rules  
(practical rigor, not methodological rigor)
- ways to think about/look at data
- familiarity with statistical techniques (GLM, basic GLMMs)
- landscape of more advanced techniques (GLMM)

## ground rules

- no "stupid" questions
- if the material seems too hard:
    - ask! I can help later
    - get what you can 
- if the material seems too easy:
    - ask! we can talk later
    - think about pedagogy

## my heros

Gelman, Harrell, Zuur (et al.), McElreath

## feedback

- post-it notes
- every day: too fast/too slow; "one up, one down"
- lots of opportunities for alternative topics
- homework
